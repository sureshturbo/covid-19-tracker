    <li><strong>What is coronavirus?</strong><br>The coronavirus is a family of viruses that can cause a range of illnesses in humans including common cold and more severe forms like <a href="/topic/SARS" target="_blank">SARS</a> and <a href="/topic/MERS" target="_blank">MERS</a> which are life-threatening. The virus is named after its shape which takes the form of a crown with protrusions around it and hence is known as coronavirus. </li>
    <li><strong>How did the recent outbreak occur?</strong><br>The recent outbreak of coronavirus is believed to have occurred in a market for illegal wildlife in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Chinese health authorities and the WHO are investigating the outbreak of the recent coronavirus.</li>
    <li><strong>Is the recent strain fatal?</strong><br>Since it's a new strain, there is no specific vaccine that can treat it. However, according to the WHO, "many of the symptoms can be treated &amp; therefore treatment based on the patientâ€™s clinical condition". However, it has already killed over 119,000 globally.</li>
    <li><strong>What steps have been taken so far to check its spread?</strong><br>The Chinese govt initially locked down Wuhan - the epicenter of the virus outbreak. However it was too late. The virus has spread to all continents now, except Antarctica.</li>
    <li><strong>How is India responding to the outbreak?</strong><br>India has expanded screening of international travellers. Few Indian travellers who were found with the coronavirus strain have been isolated and treated before their release.</li>
    <li><strong>How has it affected the economy?</strong><br>Worries are mounting that prolonged quarantines, supply chain disruptions and a sharp reduction in tourism and business travel could weaken the global economy or even cause a recession.</li>
